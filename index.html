                    Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup
language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading
Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.
                </p>

                    Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from 
local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and 
originally included cues for the appearance of the document.

                    HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With 
HTML constructs, images and other objects such as interactive forms may be 
embedded into the rendered page. HTML provides a means to create structured 
documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, 
lists, links, quotes and other items. HTML elements are delineated by tags, written
 using angle brackets. Tags such as < img /> and < input /> directly introduce 
 content into the page. Other tags such as < p > surround and provide information 
 about document text and may include other tags as sub-elements. Browsers do not
  display the HTML tags, but use them to interpret the content of the page.
HTML can embed programs written in a scripting language such as JavaScript, which 
affects the behavior and content of web pages. Inclusion of CSS defines the look 
and layout of content. The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), former maintainer 
of the HTML and current maintainer of the CSS standards, has encouraged the use 
of CSS over explicit presentational HTML since 1997.

                    In 1980, physicist Tim Berners-Lee, a contractor at CERN, 
proposed and prototyped ENQUIRE, a system for CERN researchers to use and share 
documents. In 1989, Berners-Lee wrote a memo proposing an Internet-based hypertext 
system. Berners-Lee specified HTML and wrote the browser and server software in late 
1990. That year, Berners-Lee and CERN data systems engineer Robert Cailliau 
collaborated on a joint request for funding, but the project was not formally adopted 
by CERN. In his personal notes from 1990 he listed "some of the many areas in which 
hypertext is used" and put an encyclopedia first.

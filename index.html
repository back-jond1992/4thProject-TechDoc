                    Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup
language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading
Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from 
local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and 
originally included cues for the appearance of the document.
                </p>
                <p>
                    HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With 
HTML constructs, images and other objects such as interactive forms may be 
embedded into the rendered page. HTML provides a means to create structured 
documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, 
lists, links, quotes and other items. HTML elements are delineated by tags, written
 using angle brackets. Tags such as < img /> and < input /> directly introduce 
 content into the page. Other tags such as < p > surround and provide information 
 about document text and may include other tags as sub-elements. Browsers do not
  display the HTML tags, but use them to interpret the content of the page.
HTML can embed programs written in a scripting language such as JavaScript, which 
affects the behavior and content of web pages. Inclusion of CSS defines the look 
and layout of content. The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), former maintainer 
of the HTML and current maintainer of the CSS standards, has encouraged the use 
of CSS over explicit presentational HTML since 1997.

            <article>
                <p>
                    In 1980, physicist Tim Berners-Lee, a contractor at CERN, 
proposed and prototyped ENQUIRE, a system for CERN researchers to use and share 
documents. In 1989, Berners-Lee wrote a memo proposing an Internet-based hypertext 
system. Berners-Lee specified HTML and wrote the browser and server software in late 
1990. That year, Berners-Lee and CERN data systems engineer Robert Cailliau 
collaborated on a joint request for funding, but the project was not formally adopted 
by CERN. In his personal notes from 1990 he listed "some of the many areas in which 
hypertext is used" and put an encyclopedia first.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The first publicly available description of HTML was a document 
called "HTML Tags", first mentioned on the Internet by Tim Berners-Lee in late 1991. 
It describes 18 elements comprising the initial, relatively simple design of HTML. Except 
for the hyperlink tag, these were strongly influenced by SGMLguid, an in-house Standard 
Generalized Markup Language (SGML)-based documentation format at CERN. Eleven of these 
elements still exist in HTML 4.
                </p>
                <p>
                    HTML is a markup language that web browsers use to interpret and compose 
text, images, and other material into visual or audible web pages. Default characteristics 
for every item of HTML markup are defined in the browser, and these characteristics can be 
altered or enhanced by the web page designer's additional use of CSS. Many of the text elements 
are found in the 1988 ISO technical report TR 9537 Techniques for using SGML, which in turn 
covers the features of early text formatting languages such as that used by the RUNOFF command 
developed in the early 1960s for the CTSS (Compatible Time-Sharing System) operating system: these 
formatting commands were derived from the commands used by typesetters to manually format documents. 
However, the SGML concept of generalized markup is based on elements (nested annotated ranges with 
attributes) rather than merely print effects, with also the separation of structure and markup; HTML 
has been progressively moved in this direction with CSS.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Berners-Lee considered HTML to be an application of SGML. It was formally defined 
as such by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) with the mid-1993 publication of the first proposal 
for an HTML specification, the "Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)" Internet Draft by Berners-Lee and 
Dan Connolly, which included an SGML Document type definition to define the grammar.[9][10] The draft 
expired after six months, but was notable for its acknowledgment of the NCSA Mosaic browser's custom tag 
for embedding in-line images, reflecting the IETF's philosophy of basing standards on successful prototypes. 
Similarly, Dave Raggett's competing Internet-Draft, "HTML+ (Hypertext Markup Format)", from late 1993, suggested 
standardizing already-implemented features like tables and fill-out forms.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After the HTML and HTML+ drafts expired in early 1994, the IETF created an HTML 
Working Group, which in 1995 completed "HTML 2.0", the first HTML specification intended to be treated as a 
standard against which future implementations should be based.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Further development under the auspices of the IETF was stalled by competing interests. 
Since 1996, the HTML specifications have been maintained, with input from commercial software vendors, by the 
World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). However, in 2000, HTML also became an international standard (ISO/IEC 15445:2000). 
HTML 4.01 was published in late 1999, with further errata published through 2001. In 2004, development began on 
HTML5 in the Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group (WHATWG), which became a joint deliverable with the 
W3C in 2008, and completed and standardized on 28 October 2014.

            <article>
            <p>
                HTML documents imply a structure of nested HTML elements. Tags and attributes are the 
basis of these HTML Elements. Tags and attributes work together but perform different functions.
            </p>
            <h2>What are Tags?</h2>
            <p>
                Tags are used to mark up the start of an HTML element and they are usually enclosed in angle brackets. An example of a tag is: < h1 >.

                Most tags must be opened < h1 > and closed < /h1 > in order to function.
            </p>
            <h2>What are Attributes?</h2>
            <p>
                Attributes contain additional pieces of information. Attributes take the form of an opening tag and additional info is placed inside.

An example of an attribute is:

< img src="mydog.jpg" alt="A photo of my dog." >

In this instance, the image source (src) and the alt text (alt) are attributes of the < img > tag.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Golden Rules To Remember</strong></p>
            <ol>
                <li>The vast majority of tags must be opened (< tag >) and closed (< /tag >) with the element information such as a title or text resting between the tags.
                </li>
                <li>When using multiple tags, the tags must be closed in the order in which they were opened. For example:

< strong >< em> This is really important!< /em >< /strong >
                </li>
            </ol>

        <h2>What To Avoid</h2>
        <p>Do not use Microsoft Word or any other word processor when writing HTML code, 
only an HTML editor or at the very least, your machine’s built-in notepad, is suitable for the task.

            Secondly, ensure that you’ve installed a number of different browsers such as Chrome 
and Firefox in order to preview your upcoming creation.</p>

        <header>Creating Your First Html Page</header>
        <article>
            <p>
                First off, you need to open your HTML editor, where you will find a clean white page on which to write your code.

From there you need to layout your page with the following tags.
            </p>
                <h2>Basic Construction of an HTML Page</h2>
                <p>These tags should be placed underneath each other at the top of every HTML page that you create.</p>
                    <p>
                    < !DOCTYPE html > — This tag specifies the language you will write on the page. In this case, the language is HTML 5.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    < html> — This tag signals that from here on we are going to write in HTML code.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    < head > — This is where all the metadata for the page goes — stuff mostly meant for search engines and other computer programs.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    < body > — This is where the content of the page goes.
            </p>
            <img class="image" 

            src="https://html.com/wp-content/uploads/html-homepage-layout-demo.webp"
            alt="Image showing the normal layout of an HTML page. Head tags at the top containing title tags.
            Under the head is the body with h1 and p tags. All inside HTML tags."/>
            <figcaption class="img-caption">
                <em>This is how your average HTML page is structured visually.</em>
            </figcaption>
            <h2>Further Tags</h2>
            <p>Inside the < head > tag, there is one tag that is always included: < title >, but there are others that are just as important:</p>
            <p> < title > - This is where we insert the page name as it will appear at the top of the browser window or tab.</p>
            <p> < meta > - This is where information about the document is stored: character encoding, name (page context), description.</p>
            <p><strong>Let’s try out a basic < head > section:</strong></p>
            <div class="divbox">
                <p>< head ></p>  
                <p>< title > My First Webpage< /title ></p> 
                <p>< meta charset="UTF-8" ></p> 
                <p>< meta name="description" content="This field contains information about your page. It is usually around two sentences long." >.</p> 
                <p>< meta name="author" content="Conor Sheils"> < /header ></p>
            </div>
        </article>
    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="Adding_content">
        <header>Adding Content</header>
        <article>
                <p>
                Next, we will make < body > tag.</p>
                <p>    
                The HTML < body > is where we add the content which is designed for viewing by human eyes.</p>
                <p>
                This includes text, images, tables, forms and everything else that we see on the internet each day.</p>
                <h2>How to Add HTML Headings to Your Webpage</h2>
                <p>In HTML, heading are written in the following elements</p>
                <ul>
                    <li> < h1 > </li>
                    <li> < h2 > </li>
                    <li> < h3 > </li>
                    <li> < h4 > </li>
                    <li> < h5 > </li>
                    <li> < h6 > </li>
                </ul>
                <p>As you might have guessed < h1 > and < h2 > should be used for the most important titles, while the remaining tags should be used for sub-headings and less important text.

                    Search engine bots use this order when deciphering which information is most important on a page.</p>
                    <h2>Creating Your Heading</h2>
                    <p>Let’s try it out. On a new line in the HTML editor, type:</p>
                    <p>
                        < h1 > Welcome to My Page < /h1 ></p>
                        <p>
                        And hit save. We will save this file as “index.html” in a new folder called “my webpage.”</p>
                        <p>
                        The Moment of Truth: Click the newly saved file and your first ever web page should open in your default browser. It may not be pretty it’s yours… all yours. </p>
                        <p>
                        Well let’s not get carried away; we’ve still got loads of great features that we can add to your page.</p>
                        <h2>Other Key Elements</h2>
                        <p>The are as follows:</p>
                        <table style="width:100%">
                        <tr>
                            <th>Element</th>
                            <th>Meaning</th>
                            <th>Purpose</th>
                        </tr>

                            <td>< b ></td>

                            <td>Strong</td>
                            <td>Similarly to bold, to highlight key text</td>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <td>< i ></td>
                            <td>Italic</td>

                <h2>How To Add Link in HTML</h2>
                <p>
                    As you may have noticed, the internet is made up of lots of links.</p>
<p>
    Almost everything you click on while surfing the web is a link takes you to another page within the website you are visiting or to an external site.</p>
<p>
Links are included in an attribute opened by the < a > tag. This element is the first that we’ve met which uses an attribute and so it looks different to previously mentioned tags.</p>
<h3>The Anchor Tag</h3>
<p>The < a > (or anchor) opening tag is written in the format:</p>
    <p>
    < a href  ="https://blogging.com/how-to-start-a-blog/" >Your Link Text Here < /a ></p>
    <p>
    The first part of the attribute points to the page that will open once the link is clicked.</p>
    <p>
    Meanwhile, the second part of the attribute contains the text which will be displayed to a visitor in order to entice them to click on that link.</p>
    <p>
    If you are building your own website then you will most likely host all of your pages on professional web hosting. In this case, internal links on your website will < a href=”mylinkedpage.html” >Linktle Here< /a> .</p>
    <h2>How To Add Images In HTML</h2>
    <p>
        In today’s modern digital world, images are everything. The < img > tag has everything you need to display images on your site. Much like the < a > anchor element, < img > also contains an attribute.</p>
            <p>
            The attribute features information for your computer regarding the source, height, width and alt text of the image.
    </p>
    <h3>Styling and Formats</h3>
        <p>
            You can check the file type of an image by right-clicking the item and selecting ‘Properties’.
You can also define borders and other styles around the image using the class attribute.</p>
<p>
The file types generally used for image files online are: .jpg, .png, and (less and less) .gif.</p>
<p>
Alt text is important to ensure that your site is ranked correctly on search sites and also for visually impaired visitors to your site.</p>
<p>
The < img > tag normally is written as follows:</p>
<p>
< img src="yourimage.jpg" alt="Describe the image" height="X" width="X" >
        </p>
        <h2>How To Make an HTML List</h2>
        <P>In web design, there are 3 different types of lists which you may wish to add to your site.</P>
        <H3>Ordered List</H3>
        <p>
            The first is an < ol >: This is an ordered list of contents. For example:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>An item</li>
            <li>Another item</li>
            <li>Another goes here</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Inside the < ol > tag we list each item on the list inside < li > < /li > tags</p>
        <p>For example:</p>
        <div class="divbox">
            <p>
                < ol ><br>
                < li >An item< /li ><br>
                < li >Another item< /li ><br>
                < li >Another goes here< /li ><br>
                < /ol >
            </p>
        </div>
        <h3>Unordered List</h3>
        <p>The second type of list that you may wish to include is an < ul > unordered list. This is better known as a bullet point list and contains no numbers.</p>
        <p>An example of this is:</p>
        <div class="divbox">
            <p>
                < ul ><br>
                < li >This is< /li ><br>
                < li >An unordered< /li ><br>
                < li >List< /li ><br>
                < /ul >
            </p>
        </div>
        <h3>Definition List</h3>
        <p>
            Finally, you may wish to include a definition list < dl > on your page. An example of a < dl > list is as follows:
        </p>
        <dl>
            <dt>HTML</dt>
            <dd>Hypertext markup language is a programming language used to create web pages and is rendered by a web browser.</dd>
            </dl>
            <p>
                The code used for the above is as follows:
            </p>
            <div class="divbox">
            <p>
                < dl ><br>
                    < dt >Item< /dt ><br>
                    < dd >The definition goes here< /dd ><br>
                    < /dl ><br>
            </p>
            </div>
            <h2>How To Add Tables In HTML</h2>
            <img class="image"
            src="html-hpg-table.png"
            alt="Image showing a table styled in Codepen.io"/>
            <figcaption class="img-caption">
                <em>Tables can be styled in various ways – Codepen.io offers live previews to keep track of changes.</em>
            </figcaption>
            <p>Another way to keep your website looking neat and orderly is through the use of a table.<br>

                This is definitely the most complicated part of this tutorial, however, learning it will certainly pay off in the long-run.<br>

                With this in mind, tables can still be a useful way to present content on your page.
            </p>
            <p><b>Do not use a table to layout your website. Search engines hate it and it is generally a bad idea. Just… don’t. See our CSS tutorial, instead.</b></p>
            <h3>What Does a Table Consist Of?</h3>
            <p>When drawing a table we must open an element with the < table > opening tag. Inside this tag, we structure the table using the table rows, < tr >, and cells, < td >.
            </p>
            <p>An example of an HTML table is as follows:</p>
            <div class="divbox">
                <p>
                < table ><br>
                < tr ><br>
                < td >Row 1 - Column 1< /td ><br>
                < td >Row 1 - Colunm 2< /td ><br>
                < td >Row 1 - Column 3< /td ><br>
                < /tr ><br>
                < tr ><br>
                < td >Row 2 - Column 1< /td ><br>
                < td >Row 2 - Column 2< /td ><br>
                < td >Row 2 - Column 3< /td ><br>
                < /tr ><br>
                < /table >
                </p>
             </div>
             <p>This will produce a 2-row table with 3 cells in each row.</p>

                You’ve reached the end of our absolute beginners HTML tutorial.<br>

The final step we need to complete is to close the < body > and < html > tags at the end of each page using the following HTML code:
            </p>
            <div class="divbox">
                <p>
                    < /body ><br>
                    < /html >
                </p>
            </div>
            <p>You’ve also learned to add headings, text, images, links, lists and basic tables to these pages.</p>
